[00:15.96] I'll endure the exile
[00:26.46] 
[00:58.05] The darkness of night falls around my soul
[01:01.16] And the hunter within loses control
[01:03.62] Gotta let it out, gotta let it out
[01:06.59] Gotta let it out, gotta let it out
[01:23.59] 
[01:10.03] This demon inside has ahold of me
[01:12.65] Clenching its power, trying to break free
[01:15.34] Gotta let it out, gotta let it out
[01:18.48] Gotta let it out, gotta let it out
[01:35.48] 
[01:21.73] Move fast, baby, don't be slow
[01:24.52] Step aside, reload, time to go
[01:27.74] I can't seem to control
[01:30.80] All this rage that's inside me
[01:45.80] 
[01:33.78] Pullin' shots, aimin' dots, yeah, I don't miss
[01:36.77] Branded by fire, born in the abyss
[01:39.72] Red-hot temper, I just can't resist
[01:42.63] All this vengeance inside me
[01:56.63] 
[02:36.52] All of these thoughts runnin' through my head
[02:39.51] Arm on fire, veins burnin' red
[02:42.69] Frustration is gettin' bigger
[02:45.41] Bang, bang, bang, pull my devil trigger
[03:04.91] 
[02:49.03] Embrace the darkness that's within me
[02:54.97] No hiding in the shadows anymore
[03:01.05] When this wickedness consumes me
[03:06.82] Nothing can save you and there's no way out
[03:28.32] 
[03:24.72] I'm a wildfire you won't tame
[03:27.58] Igniting my temper, can't put out my flame
[03:31.09] There's no way to contain
[03:33.70] This storm swelling inside me
[03:48.20] 
[03:36.83] I'm a bomb you can't defuse
[03:39.76] Might just accept you're gonna lose
[03:42.96] Can't turn down, I refuse
[03:45.59] To hold back anymore
[03:55.59] 
[03:51.52] All of these voices inside my head
[03:54.58] Blinding my sight in a curtain of red
[03:57.58] Frustration is getting bigger
[04:00.66] Bang, bang, bang, pull my devil trigger
[04:20.16] 
[04:03.93] When the night ends, it's not over
[04:10.33] We fight through to get closer
[04:16.54] Like a silver bullet piercing through
[04:22.07] I throw myself into you
[04:33.57] 
[05:45.86] All of these voices inside my head
[05:48.90] Blinding my sight in a curtain of red
[05:51.89] Frustration is getting bigger
[05:54.54] Bang, bang, bang, pull my devil trigger
